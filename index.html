                        Persistent uploader
                        <ul>
                            <h4>What could you do?</h4>
                            <li>When a file or directory is selected for upload, it copies the files into a local sandbox
                                and uploads a chunk at a time.
                            </li>
                            <li>Uploads can be restarted after browser crashes, network interruptions, etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Video game, music, or other apps with lots of media assets
                        <ul>
                            <h4>What could you do?</h4>
                            <li>It downloads one or several large tarballs, and expands them locally into a directory structure.</li>
                            <li>The same download works on any operating system.</li>
                            <li>
                                It can manage prefetching just the next-to-be-needed assets in the background, so going to
                                the next game level or activating a new feature doesn’t require waiting for a download.
                            <li>
                                It uses those assets directly from its local cache, by direct file reads or by handing local
                                URIs to image or video tags, WebGL asset loaders, etc.
                            <li></li>
                            <li>The files may be of arbitrary binary format.</li>
                            <li>On the server side, a compressed tarball is often much smaller than a collection of separately
                                compressed files. Also, one tarball instead of a 1,000 little files involves fewer seeks.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Audio/Photo editor with offline access or local cache for speed
                        <ul>
                            <h4>What could you do?</h4>
                            <li>The data blobs are potentially quite large, and are read-write.</li>
                            <li>It might want to do partial writes to files (overwriting just the ID3/EXIF tags, for example).</li>
                            <li>The ability to organize project files by creating directories is important.</li>
                            <li>Edited files should be accessible by client-side applications (iTunes, Picasa).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Offline video viewer
                        <ul>
                            <h4>What could you do?</h4>
                            <li>It downloads large files (>1 GB) for later viewing.</li>
                            <li>It needs efficient seek and streaming.</li>
                            <li>It should be able to hand a URI to the video tag.</li>
                            <li>
                                It should enable access to partly downloaded files (for example, to let you watch the first
                                episode of the DVD even if your download didn’t complete before you got on the plane.)
                            </li>
                            <li> It should be able to pull a single episode out of the middle of a download and give just
                                that to the video tag.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                        Offline web mail client
                        <ul>
                            <h4>What could you do?</h4>
                            <li>Download attachments locally</li>
                            <li>Caches user-selected attachments for later upload.</li>
                            <li>Needs to be able to refer to cached attachments and image thumbnails for display and upload.</li>
                            <li>Should be able to trigger the UA’s download manager just as if talking to a server.</li>
                            <li>Should be able to upload an email with attachments as a multipart post, rather than sending a file at a time in an XHR.</li>
                        </ul>
