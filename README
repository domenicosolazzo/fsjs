FSJS is a wrapper for the filesystem api in HTML5.

The library can be installed adding a script tag in the head of your home page.
<script type="text/javascript" src="lib/fsjs.js"></script>

The library allows you create, remove, move, duplicate, rename and retrieve both files and directories. Moreover, you can write on those files.
